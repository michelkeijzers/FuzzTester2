
Critical bugs/problems
----------------------
- LCD bug: LCD stops during startup (I2C Initialization problem, see Github, question asked at electronics.stack.exchange).


Nice to have
----
- Button: Swap subscriber index and debounce time
- LCD improvement: only send changed characters (copy characters from display in array, costs 4x20 = 80 bytes max), but goto-xy also takes time
- LCD improvement: send only one character per interrupt (to spread the transmit times)


Planning
--------
- Control CD4052's for transistors per group of four via a CD4051.
- Disassemble 74HC595 board
- Create simple form of Fuzz (with one or two transistors per group, one or two capacitors)
- Build analog part of fuzz on main test board
- Replace 2 LEDs with capacitors per capacitor group
- Replace 2 LEDs with transistors per transistor group
- Test analog fuzz 
- Replace all capacitors
- Replace all transistors
